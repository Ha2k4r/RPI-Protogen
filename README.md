# üé® **PROTOGEN VECTOR DRAWER FOR RGB MATRIX PANELS** üöÄ  
`An open-source project for rendering vector graphics on RGB LED matrix panels, optimized for use in protogens in fursuits. Built for Raspberry Pi with a focus on performance and real-time rendering.`

[What is a protogen you ask?](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/protogen)

### üìú **FEATURES**
- **Real-Time Rendering:** Converts vector graphics into pixel-perfect displays on an RGB matrix.  
- **Open Source:** Licensed under the **MIT License WITH ATTRIBUTION CLAUSE** for freedom to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and distribute.  
- **Raspberry Pi Basis:** Designed for the Raspberry Pi, with plans to fully leverage this Arguably overkill hardware.

## üîß **DEPENDENCIES**
This project leverages powerful libraries and frameworks to handle image processing, matrix control, and asynchronous communication:

- [OpenCV - Computer Vision Library](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)  
- [rpi-rgb-led-matrix - Control for RGB LED panels on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix)  
- [Boost.Asio - Asynchronous I/O Library](https://github.com/boostorg/asio)  
- [Boost.Asio Official Documentation](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_86_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html)

## üõ†Ô∏è **INSTALLATION**

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ha2k4r/RPI-Protogen
   cd RPI-Protogen/prootmk3
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update  
   sudo apt install libopencv-dev python3-opencv  
   sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
   ```

3. Build the project using `make`:  
   ```bash
   sudo make
   ```

4. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   sudo ./proot
   ```

## üß¨ **HOW IT WORKS**
1. **Vectors:** Accepts pre-made geometry for sprites.  
2. **Color Overlays:** Layers geometry over images or GIFs.  
3. **Matrix Control:** Continuously updates the display with smooth transitions and animations.
